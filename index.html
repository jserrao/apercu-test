    <h1>Deserted Thai beaches lure rare turtles to build most nests in 20 years</h1>

    <p>BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand has found the largest number of nests of rare leatherback sea turtles in two decades
      on beaches bereft of tourists because of the coronavirus pandemic, environmentalists say. </p>
    <p>From wild boars patrolling the Israeli city of Haifa to deer venturing into London suburbs, virus closures are
      drawing wildlife into the abandoned streets of many cities. </p>
    <p>In Thailand, with 2,765 infections and 47 deaths, travel curbs ranging from a ban on international flights to an
      appeal to citizens to stay home have brought a collapse in tourist numbers, but freed up the beaches for wildlife.

    <p>The 11 turtle nests authorities have found since last November were the highest number in 20 years, said Kongkiat
      Kittiwatanawong, the director of the Phuket Marine Biological Center. </p>
    <p>“This is a very good sign for us because many areas for spawning have been destroyed by humans,” he told Reuters.
      No such nests had been found for the previous five years. </p>
    <p>“If we compare to the year before, we didn’t have this many spawn, because turtles have a high risk of getting
      killed by fishing gear and humans disturbing the beach.” </p>
    <p>Leatherbacks are the world’s largest sea turtles. They are considered endangered in Thailand, and listed as a
      vulnerable species globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. </p>
    <p>They lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas, scarce when tourists thronged the beaches. People have also been
      known to dig into their nests and steal eggs. &nbsp; </p>
    <p>Late in March, staff at a national park in the southern province of Phanga Nga bordering the Andaman Sea found 84
      hatchlings after monitoring eggs for two months. </p>
